            The display Property
            
            The display property is used to specify how an element is shown on a web page.

            Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.

            The display property is used to change the default display behavior of HTML elements.

            Block-level Elements

            A block-level element ALWAYS starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).


            Examples of block-level elements
                1. <div>
                2. <h1> - <h6>
                3. <p>
                4. <form>
                5. <header>
                6. <footer>
                7. <section>

            Inline Elements

            An inline element DOES NOT start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

            Examples of inline elements:
                1. <span>
                2. <a>
                3. <img>

            The display Property Values
            The display property has many values:

            Value	                    Description
            1. inline	                Displays an 
                                        element as an inline element.
            2. block	                Displays 
                                        an element as a block element.
            3. contents	                Makes 
                                        the container disappear, making the child elements children of the element the next level up in the DOM.
            4. flex	                    Displays 
                                        an element as a block-level flex container.
            5. grid	                    Displays an 
                                        element as a block-level grid container.
            6. inline-block	            Displays an 
                                        element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height and width values.
            7. inline-flex	            Displays an 
                                        element as an inline-level flex container.
            8. inline-grid	            Displays an 
                                        element as an inline-level grid container.
            9. inline-table	            The element is 
                                        displayed as an inline-level table.
            10. list-item	            Let the element 
                                        behave like a <li> element.
            11. run-in	                Displays an 
                                        element as either block or inline, depending on context.
            12. table	                Let the 
                                        element behave like a <table> element.
            13. table-caption	        Let the element 
                                        behave like a <caption> element.
            14. table-column-group	    Let the element 
                                        behave like a <colgroup> element.
            15. table-header-group	    Let the element 
                                        behave like a <thead> element.
            16. table-footer-group	    Let the element 
                                        behave like a <tfoot> element.
            17. table-row-group	        Let the element 
                                        behave like a <tbody> element.
            18. table-cell	            Let the element 
                                        behave like a <td> element.
            19. table-column	        Let the element 
                                        behave like a <col> element.
            20. table-row	            Let the element 
                                        behave like a <tr> element.
            21. none	                The element is 
                                        completely removed.
            22. initial	                Sets this 
                                        property to its default value.
            23. inherit	                Inherits this 
                                        property from its parent element.

    <!-- 
            Override The Default Display Value

            As mentioned, every element has a default display value. However, you can override this.

            Changing an inline element to a block element, or vice versa, can be useful for making the page look a specific way, and still follow the web standards.

            NOTE: Setting the display property of an element only changes how the element is displayed, NOT what kind of element it is. So, an inline element with display: block; is not allowed to have other block elements inside it.
