            CSS Border - Individual Sides
            
            From the examples on the previous pages, you have seen that it is possible to specify a different border for each side.

            In CSS, there are also properties for specifying each of the borders (top, right, bottom, and left).

            So, here is how it works:

            If the border-style property has four values:

                1. border-style: dotted solid double dashed;
                        - top border is dotted
                        - right border is solid
                        - bottom border is double
                        - left border is dashed
            If the border-style property has three values:

                2. border-style: dotted solid double;
                        - top border is dotted
                        - right and left borders are solid
                        - bottom border is double
            
            If the border-style property has two values:

                3. border-style: dotted solid;
                        - top and bottom borders are dotted
                        - right and left borders are solid
            
            If the border-style property has one value:

                4. border-style: dotted;
                        - all four borders are dotted
            
            NOTE: The border-style property is used in the example above. However, it also works with border-width and border-color.
