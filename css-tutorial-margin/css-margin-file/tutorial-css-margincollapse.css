.first {

.second {

/* 
    In the example above, the <h1 class="first"> element has a bottom margin of 50px and the <h1 class="second"> element has a top margin set to 30px.

    Common sense would seem to suggest that the vertical margin between the <h1 class="first"> and the <h1 class="second"> would be a total of 80px (50px + 30px). But due to margin collapse, the actual margin ends up being 50px.
