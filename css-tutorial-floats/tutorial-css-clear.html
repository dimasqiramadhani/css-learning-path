            The clear Property

            When we use the float property, and we want the next element below (not on right or left), we will have to use the clear property.

            The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.

            The clear property can have one of the following values:

            1. none -       The element is not pushed 
                            below left or right floated elements. This is default.

            2. left -       The element is pushed below 
                            left floated elements.

            3. right -      The element is pushed below 
                            right floated elements.

            4. both -       The element is pushed below 
                            both left and right floated elements.

            5. inherit -    The element inherits the 
                            clear value from its parent

            When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left. Your floated element will continue to float, but the cleared element will appear below it on the web page.
